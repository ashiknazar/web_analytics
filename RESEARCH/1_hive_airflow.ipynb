    "### Apache Hive – Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive is used as the SQL analytics layer on top of data stored in HDFS. In this project, Hive is not theoretical; it is used to query real data generated by Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hive Tables Created\n",
    "\n",
    "- user_events_raw  \n",
    "  Stores raw user activity events written from Spark Streaming to HDFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- page_metrics_daily  \n",
    "  Stores daily aggregated page-level metrics such as visit counts and average time spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- section_engagement_daily  \n",
    "  Stores interaction counts for different sections and components of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- navigation_paths_daily  \n",
    "  Stores counts of common navigation flows between pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- geo_traffic_daily  \n",
    "  Stores user counts grouped by country, state, and city.\n",

    "#### Analytics Performed Using Hive\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Page Popularity Analysis  \n",
    "   Purpose: Identify the most visited pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output Example:\n",
    "   - /products → 12,450 visits\n",
    "   - /home → 9,830 visits\n",
    "   - /checkout → 4,210 visits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Section Engagement Analysis  \n",
    "   Purpose: Determine which page sections receive the most interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output Example:\n",
    "   - recommendation_grid → 6,120 interactions\n",
    "   - pricing_table → 3,440 interactions\n",
    "   - reviews_section → 2,980 interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigation Flow Analysis  \n",
    "   Purpose: Understand how users move inside the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output Example:\n",
    "   - /home → /products → /checkout (3,210 users)\n",
    "   - /products → /cart → /checkout (2,540 users)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Geographic Traffic Analysis  \n",
    "   Purpose: Analyze user distribution by location.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output Example:\n",
    "   - India, Karnataka, Bangalore → 5,200 users\n",
    "   - India, Maharashtra, Pune → 2,100 users\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance Metrics Analysis  \n",
    "   Purpose: Monitor application performance and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output Example:\n",
    "   - /checkout average response time → 480 ms\n",
    "   - /login error rate → 3.2 percent\n",

    "### Apache Airflow – Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow is used to automate and schedule analytics workflows involving Spark and Hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Airflow DAGs Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Daily Analytics Pipeline  \n",
    "   Schedule: Once per day\n",
    "\n",
    "   Steps:\n",
    "   - Check for daily data availability in HDFS\n",
    "   - Trigger Spark batch job for daily aggregation\n",
    "   - Refresh Hive tables\n",
    "   - Execute Hive queries for daily metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "   Result:\n",
    "   - Updated daily analytics tables in Hive\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Section Engagement Pipeline  \n",
    "   Schedule: Every 6 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "   Steps:\n",
    "   - Trigger Spark job for section-level aggregation\n",
    "   - Store results in HDFS\n",
    "   - Update section_engagement_daily Hive table\n",
    "\n",
    "   Result:\n",
    "   - Near real-time insight into section popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigation Path Analysis Pipeline  \n",
    "   Schedule: Daily\n",
    "\n",
    "   Steps:\n",
    "   - Trigger Spark job for navigation flow computation\n",
    "   - Load results into Hive tables\n",
    "   - Validate successful execution\n",
    "\n",
    "   Result:\n",
    "   - Daily navigation flow reports available for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Hive and Airflow together, the project delivers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL-based analytics over large-scale user activity data\n",
    "- Automated and repeatable analytics pipelines\n",
    "- Scheduled generation of daily and hourly insights\n",
    "- A realistic enterprise-style data analytics workflow\n"
